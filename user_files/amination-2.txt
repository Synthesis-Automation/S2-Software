# No space in names, ',' as seperator, 'mL' for liquids, 'mmol' for solids, program ignores chemical name start with '$'. 
# Reductive amination, see ref: Synthesis 2019, DOI: 10.1055/s-0037-1611788
# Conditions: Amine (0.1 mmol), AcOH (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv), MeOH (1.0 mL), carbonyl compound (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv), then NaBH3CN (0.2 mmol, 2.0 equiv,0.4 M in MeOH solution, 0.5 mL), rt for overnight, workup (diluted by water and extracted using DCM). (Note: we change to dilution using 10% Nacl solution and extraction using MeOtBu). 
# Calculation example: AcOH (FW 60, density 1.05), NaBH3CN (FW 62.8, 125.6 mg in 5mL MeOH, 0.4 M), benzylamine (FW 107.15, density 0.98)

AcOH (0.0057 mL), MeOH (0.5 mL), Isopropylaniline (0.0109 mL), Benzaldehyde (0.0102 mL), NaBH3CN (0.5 mL)
